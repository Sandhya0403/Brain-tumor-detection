# Brain Tumor Detection Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting brain tumors using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It leverages medical imaging data (such as MRI scans) to classify images as either tumor-affected or normal. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess MRI images for training.
- **Model Building**: Use deep learning frameworks (e.g., CNNs) for tumor classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Display predictions and insights using relevant plots.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-detection.git
   cd brain-tumor-detection
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook or script to train the model and test predictions.

## Dataset
The project uses an MRI brain scan dataset. Ensure the dataset is placed in the correct directory:
```
project_root/
    data/
        brain_tumor_images/
            class_0 (normal)/
            class_1 (tumor)/
```

### Dataset Source
If the dataset is public, provide the link here (e.g., Kaggle or another source).

## How to Run
1. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the project file.
   - Execute the notebook cells step by step.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. **Run as a Script**:
   - Use the Python script version for training and inference.

## Results
The project demonstrates the following results:
- Model accuracy: XX%
- Precision: XX%
- Recall: XX%

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (if used for image preprocessing)

## Future Improvements
- Integrate more advanced architectures (e.g., transfer learning, ResNet).
- Deploy the model using a web app (e.g., Flask or Streamlit).
